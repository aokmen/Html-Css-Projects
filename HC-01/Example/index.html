    <h1>What is JavaScript?</h1>
    <br><hr>
    <p>JavaScript (JS) is a computer programming language used to make websites and applications dynamic and interactive.</p>
    <h3>Think of these coding languages as the components of a house:</h3>
    <p>HTML is the foundation of the house. It provides the basic layout, structure, and content of a website. <br> <hr> CSS is the interior design. It provides design, fonts, colors, effects, and other visual elements. <hr> 
        JavaScript is the electrical and plumbing systems. JS brings dynamism and interactivity to the website. For example, pop-ups, animations, video and social media embeds, drop-down menus, and many other website components are created using JavaScript.</p>
