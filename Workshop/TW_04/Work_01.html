    <!-- HTML Summary
Our page's content, structure, and meaning are all defined using HTML (HyperText
Markup Language).
You don't use it for styling purposes. Instead, use CSS for that!
HTML uses "elements" to describe (annotate) content
Typically, HTML elements have an opening tag, content, and a closing tag.
You can also have void (empty) elements like images
You can also configure elements with attributes
There's a long list of available elements but you'll gain experience over time, no
worries.
Learn more about all available HTML elements on the MDN HTML element reference
CSS Summary
You can style the content of your page by using CSS (Cascading Style Sheets).
To assign styles, use property value pairs.
By using the "style" attribute, you can assign styles.
Typically, global styles (such as those provided by the "style" element) are used
to prevent code duplication
A different option is to use external stylesheet files that you "link" to "
Understanding terms like "inheritance," "specificity," and "the box model" is
essential while dealing with CSS.

properties and values. -->
